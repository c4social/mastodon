## What is it?
Ecko is a community-driven fork of [Mastodon's](joinmastodon.org) social network software. 
The idea for the fork is to optimize toward community, that is making it as easy as possible to contribute. We're following a protocol called the Collective Code Construction Contract (C4) that says if you are addressing a valid problem, your code gets merged. Everything else follows from that.
## What is C4?
**C4**, or Collective Code Construstion Contract is a way of developing software _(a protocol if you wish)_, that is designed to make software creation process easier to understand and to contribute for non-technical users of the software. As stated in [C4 specification](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec/42/):
>C4 is meant to provide a reusable optimal collaboration model for open source software projects. It has these specific goals:
> 1. To maximize the scale and diversity of the community around a project, by reducing the friction for new Contributors and creating a scaled participation model with strong positive feedbacks;
> 2. To relieve dependencies on key individuals by separating different skill sets so that there is a larger pool of competence in any required domain;
> 3. To allow the project to develop faster and more accurately, by increasing the diversity of the decision making process;
> 4. To support the natural life cycle of project versions from experimental through to stable, by allowing safe experimentation, rapid failure, and isolation of stable code;
> 5. To reduce the internal complexity of project repositories, thus making it easier for Contributors to participate and reducing the scope for error;
> 6. To enforce collective ownership of the project, which increases economic incentive to Contributors and reduces the risk of hijack by hostile entities.
